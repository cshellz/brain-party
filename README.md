# Brain Party

## Inspiration
We wanted to enhance primary student education and make it enjoyable for learners.

## What it does
Brain Party is a website that will serve as a resource for primary education students and provide them with educational content in an engaging way.

## How we built it
It was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a few challenges with the navigation bar as well as styling some components on the website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to successfully render the website on a browser.

## What we learned
Front end development is very tedious work and requires a lot of attention and patience because mistakes can happen so easily if you are not careful!

## What's next for Brain Party
We are planning on creating custom multiplayer games and look forward to improving it further!
